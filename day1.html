Day 1
This day belong to setup of Kotlin.

I am using SDKMAN for installing Kotlin and Java on my machine.

Vagrant and VirtualBox has been installed on my Window machine which I will use as a host to create a CentOS 7 virtual machine.

Creation of virtual machine is beyond the scop of this page.

Following commands I have used :

sudo curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash

This command needs zip and unzip on your machine. You can install them by using 
sudo  yum install unzip
sudo yum install zip

Run your command again, after install zip and unzip.

sudo curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash


SDKMAN has been installed, but it not in the path. 
You can logout from your ssh and then login again, so path is updated.

Try 
sdk 

Now, its the time to install java and kotlin

sudo sdk install java
sudo sdk install kotlin

Check if kotlin available.
kotlinc -help
